Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
{EC2.6}  VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs
{EC2.13} Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
{EC2.14} Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Enable VPC flow logging
Provide specific IP address range or remove SSH inbound rule for security groups ingress on port 22
Remove unrestricted access to port 3389
